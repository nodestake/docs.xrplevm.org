# What is the XRPL EVM?

The **XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is an innovative extension of the XRP Ledger ecosystem that integrates Ethereum's smart contract capabilities via a dedicated sidechain. Built on the Cosmos SDK, this sidechain utilizes a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus model, ensuring high performance and low latency while maintaining the fundamental attributes of the XRP Ledger. It connects to the XRP Ledger through the Axelar network, employing XRP—bridged from the XRPL—as its native currency. This allows for seamless asset transfers and communication between the XRPL and the EVM sidechain. Moreover, the XRPL EVM supports Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), promoting interoperability with other blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. 

By fusing the XRP Ledger’s confirmed speed, cost-efficiency, and security with Ethereum’s flexibility, developers can efficiently build and deploy Solidity-based smart contracts within a high-speed, low-cost, and liquidity-rich environment. Furthermore, as the XRPL EVM is compatible with popular wallets like MetaMask and Keplr, users can easily access these capabilities.

## Why Use the XRPL EVM?

The XRPL EVM bridges two robust blockchain ecosystems: the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, creating unique opportunities for developers and users:

### Cost-Efficient dApp Development

The XRPL's low transaction fees substantially decrease the costs associated with deploying and interacting with smart contracts, making it an appealing choice for developers and startups creating decentralized applications (dApps).

### Global Payments Meets Programmability

Known for its powerful global payment infrastructure, the XRPL offers added programmability through EVM compatibility. Developers can effectively manage payments programmatically with smart contracts, enabling:

- Automated settlements.
- DeFi applications including lending, staking, and yield farming.
- Tokenized cross-border transactions.

**Example:** A lending protocol on the XRPL EVM can harness XRPL's payment infrastructure to facilitate faster and more cost-effective loan settlements.

### Cross-Chain Asset Mobility

With Axelar and the XRPL EVM bridge, assets can seamlessly traverse between the XRPL and other blockchain ecosystems, enhancing interoperability for:

- Cross-chain DeFi platforms.
- Multi-chain NFT marketplaces.

**Example:** An NFT marketplace built on the XRPL EVM can accommodate assets sourced from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and XRPL.

### Enhanced User and Developer Experience

- Developers experienced with Ethereum can transition to the XRPL EVM without needing to master new tools or languages.
- Users reap the benefits of the XRP Ledger's speed and low fees while engaging with Ethereum-compatible dApps.
